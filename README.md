# Web-API-using-Axios-in-React
This is an example of how to use Axios to consume an API, in this case JSONPlaceHolder(Free fake and reliable API for testing and prototyping).

*Disclaimer:* This project was created as part of a React learning course that uses the public API JSONPlaceholder to demonstrate key concepts of frontend development and data management with Axios. While I have made modifications and improvements to the original code, the project is based on examples and structures provided during the course.
I do not claim full authorship of the design, logic, or foundational ideas of this project, as it follows the guidelines taught by the course instructor.
The shared code is for educational purposes only and should not be considered as a final product or for commercial use.

The project aims to:

1)  Learn key React concepts, such as components, state, props, and hooks.
2)  Handle external data with Axios and API integration.
3)  Implement frontend development best practices.
